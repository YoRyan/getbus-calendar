# getbus-calendar
It's a challenging life being a junior Golden Empire Transit bus driver! As an extra board employee, your work schedule is known just one day in advance. This service attempts to make planning your social life a little easier by making it easy to share your schedule with friends and family.

Just sign into your Google account, authorize the app, add a calendar to your account named "GET Bus", and then fill out the form whenever you're ready to update your schedule.

### Onboarding process
1. Add a calendar named "GET Bus".
2. Acquire the rights to the form and its attached app script.
3. In the script editor, run the `authorize` function and allow the necessary permissions.
4. Add an installable trigger to call `onSubmitForm` after submitting the form.
